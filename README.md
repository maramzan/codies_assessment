# JavaScript Problem Solving Project

This project contains solutions to a variety of JavaScript problems. Each problem is contained within its own section of the code, marked by comments.

## HTML File

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the project. It includes a series of "question blocks", each of which contains a question, a button to show the code that solves the question, and a `pre` element to display the code.

## JavaScript Files

There are two JavaScript files in this project: `script.js` and `script2.js`.

### script.js

The `script.js` file contains the code that solves each of the problems. Each solution is contained within its own function. Here's a brief overview of each function:

1. `reverseString(str)`: This function takes a string `str` as an argument, splits it into an array of characters, reverses the array, and then joins it back into a string.

2. `reverseString2(str)`: This function also takes a string `str` as an argument, but it reverses the string using a for loop.

3. `Car`: The `Car` class is a basic example of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. It has a constructor that takes `make`, `model`, and `year` as arguments, and it has two methods: `accelerate()` and `brake()`.

4. `fetchUserData()`: The `fetchUserData()` function is an example of using the Fetch API to retrieve data from an API. It uses async/await syntax to handle the asynchronous nature of the Fetch API.

### script2.js

The `script2.js` file handles the UI behavior of the project. It adds event listeners to the "Show Code" buttons in the HTML file, and updates the `pre` elements with the appropriate code when the buttons are clicked.

## Running the Code

To run the code, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can view the code for each problem by clicking the "Show Code" button.
