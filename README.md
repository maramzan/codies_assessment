# JavaScript Problem Solving Project

This project contains solutions to a variety of JavaScript problems. Each problem is contained within its own section of the code, marked by comments.

## HTML File

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the project. It includes a series of "question blocks", each of which contains a question, a button to show the code that solves the question, and a `pre` element to display the code.

## JavaScript Files

There are two JavaScript files in this project: `script.js` and `script2.js`.

## CSS File

There is one CSS file in this project: `styles.css`.

### script.js

The `script.js` file contains the code that solves each of the problems. Each solution is contained within its own function.

### script2.js

The `script2.js` file handles the UI behavior of the project. It adds event listeners to the "Show Code" buttons in the HTML file, and updates the `pre` elements with the appropriate code when the buttons are clicked.

## Running the Code

To run the code, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can view the code for each problem by clicking the "Show Code" button.
